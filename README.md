# berryapps
berryapps is a simple "package manager" for apps not in the repositories.

## this project is still in development, so things might not work.
the goal is to be able to use this app like `apt`, usage will be something like this: `berry install box86` to install a precompiled version of box86 or `berry compile box86` to compile it from source.

berryapps will make use of existing projects, and just make them easy to access.
